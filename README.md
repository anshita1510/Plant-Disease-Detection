🌱 Plant Disease Detection System for Sustainable Agriculture

This project is a web-based application built using Deep Learning (TensorFlow/Keras) and Streamlit that helps in detecting plant diseases from leaf images. It is designed to support farmers, researchers, and agricultural experts in promoting sustainable farming practices by enabling early disease detection and reducing crop losses.
